overall goal:
- make programming easier, faster and more enjoyable

solution ideas:
- separate displaying from editing
    - parseless code
	- bind names explicitly
	- no ambiguity in identifiers
	- can display anything that makes sense without worrying about parsing ambiguity
	- question: how to edit such a representation?
	- negative: lose some editing speed?

- contexts:
	- filter out information by contexts
		- semantic: problem, that is solved
		- types   : types of the variables
		- memory  : how the memory is managed
		- codegen : how the code is generated (?)
