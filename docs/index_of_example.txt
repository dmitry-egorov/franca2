task:
	- index of item in an array

how it's displayed:

find index of item in array
    return
		loop over array
			if element is item then break with index
		else not found

alternative:

find index of 'item in 'array
 <- loop over array
		element == item ? index
	: not found


- it's not a plain text
- each item has additional visual elements, like icons, highlights and lines
- some items can be expanded to show extra details
	- memory allocation
	- types
	- etc.

contexts:
- memory context:
	- show where each entity is allocated
		- array is a name of an array, allocated on the stack
	- show as an icon?

- types context
	- show and edit types of variables
	
- types of statements context
	- is it a declaration or something else?

- display context:
	- e.g. rename loop variable
	- display functions differently

- runtime function context
	- context passed to each function
	- allocator, thread_local etc.
