- named arguments in the form of lists?
    - def[id[recursive_fib_at] disp[recursive fib at $[n]] body[...]]
    - are nodes self-sufficient or require to be within a context of another node?
- alternative implementations for functions
    - functions can have multiple implementations, that share the same signature
    - signature can differ in implicits that it accepts?
        - e.g. one function allocates memory, and another doesn't
- how to change display properties of an inner node?
    - display strings in different color, when they're a part of a function definition?
