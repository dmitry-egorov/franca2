References

- can resolve this by requiring references call (&[x]) to be explicit

name of the local can be a reference or a value

if it's a reference, we don't emit code, but pass local id to the called function
if it's a value, we emit the code

the behaviour depends on the context, specifically the function being called

everything is more complicated, since the functions are polymorphic
