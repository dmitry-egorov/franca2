There's can be two types of scopes
- regular scope, where the results of a previous operation is discarded
- stack scope, where the results of a previous operation is kept on the stack, mimicking wasm


## Regular scope
var[a u32 1]
var[b u32 2]
=[a b]
etc...

## Stack scope
local.get
index_of[b]
local.set
index_of[a]

We probably shouldn't mix this two.

The stack scope is probably better imagined as a compiletime execution scope, where we explicitly invoke emit methods?
