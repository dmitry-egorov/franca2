# Franca Programming System

The ideas I want to explore:
- code lens
- most language constructs are defined in the language itself
- nesting is unambiguous in the core language
- compile time execution with jit
  - or edit time execution
- functions are macros by default
  - similar to inline functions
  - with lambda-like code embedding (but at compile time)
- do as much as possible at compile time
- low level language at the base, with optional high-level abstractions on top
  - no garbage collection in the core language
- implicitly passed context
